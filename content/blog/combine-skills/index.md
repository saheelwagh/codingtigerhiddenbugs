# You cannot add two skills and expect them to sum up
 Read that again. 

 Did you find it absurd ?

 You most likely spent your early (or late, who am I to judge) life picking up new skills because people told you those will add up to something useful. If you live in an urban area, chances are kids around you pursue multiple co-curricular activities, chasing an all-round development. It's likely that such kids perform better not only academically, but also in life,overall compared to those children that do not enroll for any co-curricular activites. 
 You yourself might have experienced higher competency in your field of work after you took up a new hobby or some supplementary course. 

 Why is this random nobody on the internet then proclaiming that skills do not add up? Who is he to challenge conventional wisdom about personality development ?

 I do intend to challenge conventional wisdom but I am not going against it. After learning from multiple failures in the last decade and observing many achievers, I have a firm belief that skills don't add up.

 They multiply.

 That's correct. 

 Every new skill you learn doubles your chance of success. These are not my words. These are the words of {}. He's a renowed author and the creator of Dilbert, a hugely popular comic strip.
 
 This post is an attempt at
 1. Sharing some insights from his book "How to fail at almost anything and still succeed at life."
 2. Cheeky marketing of my new app (that's if I hold your interest till the end.)

{} talks about how he 
1. Tried different ventures and
2. Took relevant courses 
over the span of his life. He says these actions taught him skills and revealed insights that helped him succeed at work. Not just his current (long term) successful venture of Dilbert but also his early jobs. To him at the point of time when he stumbled upon these opportunities (like when he was offered a job interview by a CEO on a plane just because he happened to be suited up) and when he succeded at these chances (often against common sense) he must've attributed his success to pure luck. However, looking back he notes that the major reason why he succeded was because he happened to have the right combination of skills required to complete (or manouvre) around the tasks he was assigned. 
Some experiences he talks about are :
Experince 1. 
Skills gained :

Experience 2. 
Skills gained :

Experience 3 : 
skills gained .

He then argues that these skills did not add up linearly, but multiplied to attract disproportionate rewards. According to him the best way to pick up these skills is to sample multiple avenues and pick up relevant skills quickly. This is one reason why parents pack their children's schedule with multiple activities. They hope that the kids will gain skills that will serve them for a lifetime. 

The differentiating factor between activities that propel your life forward and the ones that hold you back and waste your time are is early success (and hence early reward). {} argues that not only does motivation bring success but the converse is also true. Success brings motivation. The skills that get you quick success also invariably get you a recognition. This recognition gets tied to your identity. As per another excellent book sw!tch , the best way to bring a change is to change your identity.
If you write a genius python script while in school (note : at this level even writing a script that takes your name as input and returns it along with an expletive gets you street cred, based on personal experience.) you become known as a prodigious coder. This early identity boost motivates you to pursue programming lifelong.
If you quickly win some chess games and gain an elo rating, you become known as a competent chess player. Your thinking changes from moving individual pieces to recognizing patterns, because that's what grandmasters do.
Successful journalists and writers are more likely to have won writing contests early in childhood or have got their work published in kids magazines or some local daily.
Successful(?) thieves are more than likely to have got an early headstart by stealing petty things. Same with your childhood conny friend who is now a succesful politician. (Your amicable friend if he joins politics on the other hand is more likely to fail. Or worse, be a secretary of the thugs above them.)

These skills may come naturally to you. Even then you will not value them until you attract a tangible reward. Another inherent acharacteristic of these skills is that you are prepared to put in a lot of deliberate practice into them without getting frustrated. 
If you're learning programming you will seek solution to bugs that you encounter from your own understanding first, instead of running to others (see : gooogle) for help. The more you practice this debugging skill the faster you will overcome bugs and the less you will be frustrated by broken code.
{} talks about a kid who keenly picked up a swinging technique while learning tennis, at the age of three. This was likely aided by how he had already figured out leveling up at other sports (more on this later.)
A child artist serious about her acting skills will take feedback constructively instead of getting disheartened after an inevitable bad performance. 

So how do you pick up relevant skills quickly at a minimum cost ? And how do you figure out the right combination ?

1. Fail fast : as aforementioned, you will not see value in any skill until you see its relevant benefit. Don't say no to poortunities , the right time will never come. When in doubt, accept the job or the contract and then figure out how to perform it. Don't convince yourself that anything is impossible. However, as soon as possible examine which skill is infeasible for you to master. For example, I can destroy newbie chess players all day.I even have some trophies that I won in childhood but I can hardly keep up with rated players. I will need at least 5 years of daily practice to earn my first norm. And there is no value for me in doing that unless I have a job that pays and spares an hour or two for chess practice. Speaking of job, programming is my bread and butter. But I've never been fascinated by programming micro processors or writing system drivers. It's a hard skill to master and the time that I put in will not fetch me justifiable amount of happiness. When you realise that the skill is not feasible in terms of 1) time 2) sacrificing peace of mind, quickly move on to the next skill. 
2. Know your obsessions. This might be tricky to notice once you start growing up. Your brain is more malleable till early teenage. Every once in a while you will notice you love an activity so much that you forget the sense of time (really hope it's not browsing facebook). When it comes to this skill you will be prepared to make short term sacrifices in hope of long term wins. This could be the case of a basement programmer who stays up late at night building the software of his dream, the musician who performs at local joints even though that might mean less leisure time (even less considering the practice you put in). The football player who stays up some hours later working upon his weaker foot. Whether knownigly or not, you perform activities and reshape your brain in ways that align with long term success. And the best part ? you don't even feel like you are working. You are in flow state and experiencing pure joy.
   
Make an inventory of the skills that satisfy the above two criteria. Then reflect upon your life until this point, trying to  decode how these skills combined to lead you to where you currently are.
Deconstructing your current journey is only half the story. To correctly determine where you should maximise your efforts, you should have some visualization of how your skills can be combined and what gaps to fill in your knowledge. 
You can do it with pen and paper and interacting with maximal people. But there is only so much that an individual can be exposed to when it comes to how to be of value in the world. 

That is why I have built Visual Skill Studio. You can mix and mesh skils and see how they combine into something lucrative. Sort of like an ikigai calculator, only crowdsourced. It runs on JAMstack and github. You can easily add your own skills or fetch one from the repository of crowd knowledge. What I aim to achieve is instanatenous visualization of your future. Over time I plan to add more features such as guided paths, common pitfalls to avoid and matching up with mentors. I hope it can assist a large number of people in maximizing their happiness (and $$$). And if this venture fails ? visualskill.studio will work just as well as the name of a web desing agency which is my bread earner. (Quickly generating plan B is a skill that came naturally to me.)

So how will you double your chance of success ?
