# Lessons from Multiple Hackathon losses

I love hackathons. I wish I could participate in one every day of my life. Alas, that wouldn't be sustainable. My body will run out of steam, organizers will run out of problems to llook for and hackers will run of of perspectives as they've been stuck on one problem for too long.
1. There's my first problem , staying stuck for too long. The issues I faced were about configuration. I did not even write any creative code. I wrote a trvial piece of code and hoped my smarter teammates would handle all the business logic while I fumbled at hooking my toy code into the UI.
2. The reason I was stuck was because we did not properly plan the architecture. If we had researched about the data structures and the feasibility of translating logic, we would not have faced this issue 12 hours too late. This was the first time I truly understood the importance of data structures.
3. the reason we did not plan the arch was because we did not properly brain storm. Idea should have been fixed week back. When it was fixed, should have myself made attempts to deconsturct it instead of using silence of teammates as a nod.
4. Get the stack ready. It's a sin to configure repo and installation once the hacking begins.
5. Do research beforehand on past submissions.
6. Generate skeletal app first thing. Then only set about doing your creative works.
7. Talk to mentors and see what they are looking for.
8. Always be decounstructing. Pair program to fix issue. Preferably do this away from someone who is not having any problem.
9. Discuss idea with more people. Interact with fellow hackers.
10. Face issues head on before they boil over the top.
11. Push through on the last day. Sleep not more than the required minute. That morning is not the one to relax.
12. Don't think about the cash prize (bad omen).
13. Work on presentation from the beginning. Even 5 minute bursts will be enough.
14. Write or illustrate often.
15. Dont be glued to screen for too long
16. Hydrate, pereferably away from the spot. Helps you think.
17. When you feel like giving up, just start modifying small bits of code.
18. ANy network related tasks get them done the night before. 
19. Use kanban.
20. Push your creativity but focus on the USP and at max one additional feature.
21. Move fast instead of perfecting things.
22. Learn to effectively google
23. Master command line and code editor
24. Maintain energy. Note when it is going down.
25. Ruthlessly discard waste efforts.
