## Putting behind the worst decade of my life
Well, I have only been on this planet for two decades. Hence there was already a 50% chance of the last decade being the worst. Adding to it, no one's childhood is exceptionally bad unless they are born in extremem poverty or have to suffer inexplicable trauma. I was fortunate to avoid both the factors, which brings the proobability of 2010s being the worst decade of my life close to 100%. And even then, the amount of lows I hit over the span of the last 10 years was staggering. I have gone through
 >Failures
 >Heartbreaks
 >Identity Crisis
 >Complicating ties with family
 > Imposter Syndrome
 > Accute loneliness
 and many other setbacks that will fill up a blog post on their own. 

 ### But looking back at the last 10 years, I feel fortunate
1. To have found genuine friends who backed me up when I 
 had nothing to offer them other than just being myself. When someone finds value in your true self you know they are never going to quit on you.
1. To live in a family that loves me unconditionally and accepts me even as a misfit.
2. To  not have developed any harmful addictions (habits exluded from scrutiny : raiding the fridge for deserts and consuming fish as if all fishes would be extinct by next year )
3. To have made a positive impact on a handful of youngsters.
4. To not (yet) be attached to any toxic person or job that I would feel unhappy for dedicating my time towards.
5. To hvae developed the emotional intelligence not to judge life by the amount of money one earns or any other emtric that the society forces you to use. 
6. To have found my passion(/s) 
7. To have explored new places, lifestyles and ways of thinking.
8. To have loved only those who even in rejection delivered many valuable lessons on values, integrity and discovering myself.
9.  To have learnt to criticise myself and seek ways to improve. 
10. To have savoured small wins and developed a healthy competitive spirit coupled with a long term vision.

Thus I treat the decade as a happy one overall. If I am given a chance to relive it again the only two changes I would make would be to 
1. Take more care of my body. Play more, sleep more and rest more often.
2. Speak out sooner. Let people know how I feel before they start walking over me.

## Systems for the new decade

1. Replace goals with systems.
2. Wake up at a fixed time. (No compulsion on sleeping at a fixed time.)
3. Always be shipping.
4. Journal
5. Face a new rejection every week.
6.
