# How I turned vscode into the ultimate blogging editor with a dead-simple key combination
## With a little help from markdown

### I believe a text editor for blogging should have the follwoing essential features (ranked in order of imprtance)
1. Distraction free screen. No menu elements, just you, your keyboard and the screen
2. Tied to the writer's identity, no element in its design should make me feel like I'm putting in extra efforts to use this software. In other words, minimal fricition in UX
3. In built time tracking. Hardcore writers may prefer word count but in the flow state I prefer seeing how much time I have been writing, I can check the word count later (point 4)
4. I prefer specialized tools, and I prefer web apps. As a result I don't value grammatical help or character count while I'm typing away. I just want to dump my thoughts. Write first, edit later.
   
### Although aimed at programming, I have founf vscode to be capable of satisfying all the above feautres ( as is usual for vscode, with some plug-ins)
1. Distraction free mode
2. I already use it heavily for programming. I know the ins and outs of its interface and keybindings
3. Time tracking with wakatime
4. Just concentrate on writing in markdown. Edit later with resources like grammarly.

### So how do we turn vscode into a write-at-your-speed-of-thought editor ?
1. ctrl + K + Z . It's that simple. Press ctrl + k, release and press Z. The sidepane dissapears. The menu gets hidden. And you are left with just the screen and your words. You might be disappointed with me for showing something so mundane, but not enough people harness the power of fullscreen. (Try reading a big blog post in fullscreen mode and notice how much faster you read it.)
2. Install markdown extension
3. Install and configure wakatime for daily/weekly time tracking. (You should anyway be using it for your progmramming.
4. Fix grammatical errors and improve the semantic within grammarly.
