# The guaranteed method to waste your year
## and may be your decade too

### For me the last decade was a failure.
1. I failed repeatedly at acadcemics. If I try to recollect what I learnt in the last decade at school or college it's just a haze, a thick fog which only gets clear in some places. It wasn't like I was admitted in courses completely out of my interest, but at every time a major hurdle presented itself, I chickened out and did not regain interest in whatever I was trying to learn.
2. I completely gave up on my amateur chess career. I can now only look at people with envy who managed their sports without affecting their academics, and they have progrssed so well over the last 10 years.
3. I failed at relationships. I have lesser friends, lesser interaction with family and lesser acquaintaces and am seen at a lot lesser family functions.

I can list out a dozen of such avenues. That will make this post about me. That isn't the intention behind penning this down. Instead  I want to share the one thing that kept me going through this phase of failure. That one thing provided me an excuse from the constant emotional pressure. It made me appear as someone of value in other's eyes even though all I could see in the mirror was a trainwreck.  Every now and then it made me spring out of my bed in anticipation instead of pulling the bedsheet over my head trying to sleep out the early hours of the morning which were full of human interaction.

I see that one thing on decline not just in me but everywhere around me. It scares me seeing so many people close to me turning into robots because they are giving up on this one thing. this problem is more pervalent in younger people (around 20yo) but curiously enough it is also rapidly taking over the elders, or boomers as they're referred to in memes. 


# That one thing is the act of creation.
All of us consume information all day. The internet has made retrieving information  a trivial task. Companies are constantly tracking your internet usage to train their machine learning models to hook you deeper into their services. These models are so efficient that you follow a path (or many paths over the course of a day) carefully designed by these companies without having any hint that your brain is not in control of these interactions.

The real cost you pay for this not in terms of the time wasted. It is not even financial (you'll only pay for things you can afford without). 

The real cost is your brain power. Here's how you waste your intelligence through mindless consumpyion
1. Decision fatigue. There is so much content available to choose from that you get tired simply from choosing what to consume.
2. Cleverly integrated micro interactions designed to chip away at your willpower
3. Emotional investment. Comparison with others who post only their highlights.

How can producing help :
1. Discover yourself better. You'll know what your brain is good at processing and what skills you need to develop.
2. Free up your emotions. Even more necessary now as there are lesser meaningful connections available.
3. Get real feedback from people that matter.
4. Find your calling. Have something to look forward to every morning.
5. Learn when your body works the best. 
6. Make time for things that matter. get Better at time management.
7. Overcome fear of rejection.


How not producing will ruin your day, then week, month, year and decade
1. Not knowing what to do when you wake up, without this you are demotivated throughout the day.
2. Lose critical thinking capacity and easily be manipulated.
3.
