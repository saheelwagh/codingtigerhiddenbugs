# I've recently turned a freelance web developer

I have some exams to answer till which I do not want to commit to a full time job. But until then I need a source of income to pay my bills.

After a not so long deliberation I zeroed down on freelancing as the most optimal source of income based on the time I can dedicate.

## I was lucky to get a project without any marketing. But somehow the work is just not getting done. It's not that I hate this job. But I am procrastinating too much.

Recently I chanced upon an [article](https://medium.com/naga-rakesh/11-characteristics-of-successful-freelancers-and-entrepreneurs-9a7f4afd5a7) by Rakesh Naga Chinta detailing 11 characteristics of a successful freelancer. Below I will list out those and rate myself for each. (1-> good 0-> neutral, -1 -> bad)

1. Hard Work -> 0
2. Communication skills. Written ->1, Verbal -> -1
3. Professionalism -> -1
4. Time management and organisation -> -1
5. Peristence -> 1
6. Responsibilty -> -1
7. Initiative -> 1
8. Principles -> 1
9. Goal and Evaluation Oriented -> 0
10. Flexibility -> 1
11. Self discipline -> -1
12. Passion and skills -> 1

Phew! Quite a brutal takedown that!. Good news is I can only get better from here on.
