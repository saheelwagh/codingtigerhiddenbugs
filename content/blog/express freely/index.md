> *** Creativity ***
> â€‹the ability to use skill and imagination to produce something new or to produce art; 
> the act of doing this
>  -Oxford Dictionary

The definition of creativity above will be accepted as a standard by numerous teachers around the world. The same will be inculcated into their student's minds. As a result, whenever they hear the word creative, the first thing that will come to these young thinker's minds will be a beautiful painting they saw somewhere, or a heart toucing poem perhaps. The same way that I used to feel.
Now I have two issues with this school of thought. 
---
The first issue is the usage of the word: art. You do not have to be an artist to be creative. Creativity is shown when you solve a problem in a more efficient manner than conventional methods might suggest. Creativity is also displayed when you come up with a witty dialogue to deal with difficult people. Creativity shines through when you make changes in your lifestyle and escape your daily routine.

If I write a node module that sets up a predefined .gitignore file at the execution of a command, shaving a few seconds off my config time at the beginning of each new project, am I not being creative ?

Imagine you're teaching your 9 year old cousin how to play chess. Having never previously refered to any workbook he comes up with a sequence of moves that  appears to be the best local choice, is he not being creative ? (based on a true story)

When that girl you're not much into asked you out and you came up with a reason so good she really empathized with you, were you not at your creative best ? (definietly not based on a true story )

The second issue is about a subtle aspect that the oxford definition does not explicitly mention. But this assumption is made by almost everyone that creativity is to be displayed to the world. Something new that you produce should be pleasing to the eyes of the spectators. As a result so many creative outlets are shut, so many pieces of work never reach completiton, in the fear that it'll not be liked by people.

According to me creativity proving to your own brain that it can syntesize something new, something useful, something valuable.

### Being Creative
Creativity does not appear out of the blue. It appears the most in people who have  a system in place. These systems could be put in place intentionally or by years of unintentional practice. To bring out your creative best, you need to lower the barrier to express yourself. Some methods to achieve this :
1. Lower the number of people you have to express to. Right now as I write this blog post expecting zero visitors I have only myself to display this post to.
2. Set a routine for your creative work. You can either fix a set time of the day for this, or carve out chunks of time towards this activity once you complete certian pre defined tasks.
3. Consistency. Fix upon a place to dump your thoughts, set aside a space in your room for your paintings, fix a corner of the house where you practice your signing.
4. Ensure your work looks good. No one likes an ugly outcome. You can only ensure that you will create a beautiful piece if you are passionate about your craft.

### Case Study : Reason behind starting this blog

I already have a 2 year old medium blog with 200+ followers. A couple of my articles there have crossed 2k views each. So why would I need to start an entirely new blog with zero followers, zero social plugins and required a (small) investment towards buying the domain name ? (on a side note : This blog is run on a static site generator and hosted for free at netlify, which definietly eased the decison to start and maitain a new blog.)

Let me try to summarize the reasons and understand the psychology behind each.
1. Ownership of content : Medium can delete my posts anytime it wants. The publications there (a must now, if you want to reach a wide audience) can make any edits they see fit to my submissions. While neither of that has happened till now, I feel a sense of responsibility and freedom by owning my content. It's up to me to maintain the quality of this blog. And that automatically motivates me to keep posting quality content, or post any content in the first place. I doubt I my intrinsic motivation would be of the same level towards contributing to someone else's platform. 
2. Markdown is fun : I love the hands on approach to formatting that markdown supports. I can now understand why some people love vi/vim so much. There's a unique feel to tools that you can reach into and tweak by yourself that you will not get from point and click abstractions . If I ever write a novel I will do it in a fully featured word processor, but for one off articles markdown strikes the right balanc of speed, freedom and customizability.
3. Speaking of markdown, I can write this post on vscode. And I use a plugin named wakatime on my vscode that tracks the amount of time I spend coding. I believe articulating your thoughts is well and trully a part of a programmer's workday and  I love that my time penning (typing) down my thoughts is getting added to a trackable record. This also serves as an extrinsic motivation to write more.
4. Gatsby is simple. It is simple to set up, deploy and maintain. It literally took only two commands to set up and deploy this blog. This is a big plus point to anyone looking to get started.
5. Gatsby is complex : While it is easy to set up and comes with a beautiful layout by defualt, this blog is fully customizable. I do not have enough react knowledge to tune it fully to my liking yet, but I will keep learning and tweaking, and all that I learn will be tranferrable to any react job, as opposed to something like wordpress. This is a form of gamification wherein I get as better as writing a post as I get better at customizing the blog that hosts it. And that's fun!
6. No one to please, except myself. I can add any number of posts in a day and no one would notice, and that's a good thing : I can be my genuine self without the fear of being judged.

### Takeaway : How to express yourself without fear
1. Pick something you are passionate about.
2. Work on something that is fun as well as challenging.
3. Don't obsess over delivering the end product, instead try your best to make it easier to get started.
4. Produce something beautiful, at the least something neat.
5. Make it a habit. Familiarize yourself with the tools you use and get your brain used to operating at a fixed time and place.
6. Choose your circle of confidence. Surround yourself with people who motivate you, correct you and genuinely want you to grow. If I gave you the link to this article than I count you as one of them. An easy way to distinguish these people from condesceting or damaging folks : Whem they praise you or crticise you, they make it about you, not about themselves.
7. Make it about you. Your professional projects should be decoupled from your identity. But your creative work? It should scream your name in every possible manner. Don't worry about optimizing too much, your work will enhance itself as your personality gets enhanced.
8. Have an ultimate  comepetitive aim. I will not stop posting articles on medium. I will refine my skills and keep engaging with its huge audience with my aim of earning in thousands of dollars through its partner program. And I will not stop there. And I will not stop there. I will not stop until I have published my own nowels, until people start recognizing me for my written words. But all in good time
   
For now I will continue blowing over this spark that has ignited in my mind. One day it will light a raging fire inside me and bring out everything that I have been holding back in the last 6 years which were the toughest years of my life. One day I will be glad that I stopped hiding in the shadows and started expressing myself freely.
