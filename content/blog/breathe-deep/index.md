# I nevr had a starting problem
> I started programming before completing high school
> I started writing before my peers in school could read and put together more than a dozen sentences
> I started playing chess at 7 and could soon beat my parents (who taught me) at it.
> I started delivering tech talks before graduating from college 
> I started boxing training before fitness became a thing, both in terms of a social wave and in terms of my brain understadning its importance.


## But I have always had two problems, show-up problem and finishing problem
> Ask my peers, I hardly showed up in college
> I went months , probably years without promgramming or writing a simple essay, and these are what I called my hobbies.
> I never showed up to the first chess coaching class I was enrolled to and there wass never any second after that.
> I failed to build any decently sized software project that required consistent efforts. This despite taking part in multiple hackathons (winning prizes at two) and gaining quite a handful of street cred as the ideas-guy and the jack of all trades(in a good way.)

## So why do I want to start up ? 
Make a mental image of me from the preceding two paragraphs and you would imagine someone that is perefctly suited to found a startup and fail at it, probably spectacularly.  An ideal entrepreneur would be someone who shows up everyday, focuses his energy on the essential few tasks and gets things done. I come of as a polar opposite. An ideal startup owner must stop chasing after every new shiny thing. I have wasted around 6 years of my life doing exactly that. An entrepreneur needs to have a long term vision. I lack it so badly that I went the whole of my (extended) life at college not having any concrete plan about what I would do once I passed out.  
So why do I want to go down this path which seems bound to lead me to failure?
1.  To prove (more to myself than others) that I can bring value to the world.
2.  To discover the path to become a proficient developer, and at the same time share the knowledge in an easy to consume format.
3.  To silence my inner critic
4.  To learn how to sell
5.  To learn the process of gathering user requirement
6.  To instill a work culture in myself
7.  To develop a habit of delivering and finishing.
8.  To gain mastery on a)text editor b)operating system c) language
9.  To learn the process from start to finishing.
10. To get the first paying customer
11. To understand my preferred schedule, I can't do this while working for someone.
12. To become a remote ready employee.
13. To apply what I have learnt about : lean startup, psychology and product engineering.
14. To have a reason to jump out of bed every day (this can be true even if you have a job)
15. To learn to celebrate small wins
16. To be more mindful of my actions, manage time better and spend more time with my family.
17. To encounter new people and learn from them.
18. To help people learning to code not feel like juniors but to make them feel competent.
19. To collect resources to succed and use the same to grow the platform
20. To get familiar with flow state.
