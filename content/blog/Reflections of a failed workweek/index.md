Oct 28 - Nov 1 Was my first proper workweek as a freelancer. I had no other commitments to fulfill, allowing me to fully focus on the work, or so I thought. 
Instead with no restrictions on my time, no impending deadlines to increase my stress, I got almost no work done. In hindsight I should have utilized my sunday to schedule my week. As there was np structure, I just kept deferring my work to the next available slot. And the slots when they become avaialable, invariantly come with a new set of destructions.

Some outside causes that ruined my workweek :
1. Two days of festivities. 
2. Eating out with friends.
3. Improper exercise schedule
4. Social media

Inside cause that left me vulnerable to all of the above : 
1. No proper schedule.
2. Experimentation on a fixed 9-5 workday, refusing to work anytime before or after
For the next workweek here are the lessons I am going apply :
1. Freelancing cannot happen 9-5. Rather, there is no benenfit of doing it 9-5. 
2. My mind works best in short bursts, not continuous long stretches. 
3. When you sign up to freelance, you have to admit that work can happen any time of the day and it is your responsibility to ensure work life balance, not the client.
4. Breaks are seriously underrated, perhaps even more so than sleep. 
5. You have flexi to work on whatever you like, use it to your advantage. The problem with this freedom is you can easily go off trrack and get stuck on something trivial. The remedy I am going to try is to work in 25 minute pomodoros on each task and switch to the next after a short break. Here's a list of my tasks : 1) Freelance web project 2) Python and ml 3) Study for final exam 4) Fullstack web dev with js
6. Routines, routines, routines: Some works are just not possible ti finish without working in long stretches. Carve out such a stretch from your daily life (Keep the timing fixed) . It will get easier with each passing day to get started.
