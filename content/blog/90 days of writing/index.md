I just finished a concise yet detailed blog post by [Shaunta Grimes note : paywall metered medium article](https://medium.com/the-1000-day-mfa/how-to-be-a-writer-a-90-day-blueprint-497439155741)

She has nicely laid down a 90 days mastreplan for becoming a (better ) writer.

It goes like this

1. Read at least three novels. Study the writing style and inherit what what you like. I will go a step furtherand make it 3 books per fortnight. Which will let me study 18 books, 6 each of : fiction, non fiction and technical
2. Read a writing craft book. Implement what you learn. I don't yet have a good writing book. Unless I find one on the cheap for kindle, I will substitute this with article on blogs like The Writer's Co-operative.
3. Read a poem, a short story and an essay every day. I will do this every night at 12-1 and supplelement this with a 15 minute oe 30 minute seesion of writing/composing every morning around 7.30
4. Write fiction for 10 minutes every day. I can do this every afternoon after lunch or in commutes.
5. Connect with other writer. get in touch with juniors and online communities
6. Be rejected, at least once a month. I will start submitting articles to newspapers
7. Blog every day. This blog is an effort towards the same.

> My start date for this challenge: 1st November
> Estimated end date : 28th February 2019

> Potential benefits (written in present term by my furute self). For details on this startegy read the book, 'Think and Grow Rich' :

1. Stripe has begun business in India and I have begun earning through its partner program.
2. I am being invited for writing paid articles.
3. My writing skill has improved so much that I can consider writing a novel.
4. I have compiled a collection of poems.
